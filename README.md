# Pizza-ML
A machine learning decision tree model for classifying pizza orders based on user preferences.

This is a beginner-level machine learning project that models a pizza ordering system using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model takes user preferences like pizza size, crust type, veg/non-veg, drinks, and cheese, and classifies the order into predefined categories.
